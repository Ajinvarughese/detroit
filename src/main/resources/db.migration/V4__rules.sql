The operator of the activity ensures that the three heaviest material categories used to construct the building, measured by mass in kilogrammes, comply with the following maximum total amounts of primary raw material used: for the combined total of concrete(82)This concerns the material concrete, including its constituent ingredients (for example, aggregates). Any steel reinforcement is excluded since this is a different material which can be accounted for under metals., natural or agglomerated stone, a maximum of 70% of the material come from primary raw material; for the combined total of brick, tile, ceramic, a maximum of 70% of the material come from primary raw material; for bio-based materials(83)Bio-based materials are made using biological resources (animals, plants, micro-organisms and derived biomass, including organic waste), as defined in COM(2018) 673.

The assessment is based on recent, comprehensive and accurate data, including monitoring data on biological quality elements that are specifically sensitive to hydromorphological alterations, and on the expected status of the water body as a result of the new activities, as compared to its current one. It assesses in particular the cumulated impacts of this new project with other existing or planned infrastructure in the river basin. 3.2. On the basis of that impact assessment, it has been established that the plant is conceived, by design and location and by mitigation measures, so that it complies with one of the following requirements: the plant does not entail any deterioration nor compromises the achievement of good status or potential of the specific water body it relates to; where the plant risks to deteriorate or compromise the achievement of good status/potential of the specific water body it relates to, such deterioration is not significant, and is justified by a detailed cost-benefit assessment demonstrating both of the following: the reasons of overriding public interest or the fact that benefits expected from the planned hydropower plant outweigh the costs from deteriorating the status of water that are accruing to the environment and to society; the fact that the overriding public interest or the benefits expected from the plant cannot, for reasons of technical feasibility or disproportionate cost, be achieved by alternative means that would lead to a better environmental outcome (such as refurbishing of existing hydropower plants or use of technologies not disrupting river continuity). 3.3. All technically feasible and ecologically relevant mitigation measures are implemented to reduce adverse impacts on water as well as on protected habitats and species directly dependent on water. Mitigation measures include, where relevant and depending on the ecosystems naturally present in the affected water bodies: measures to ensure downstream and upstream fish migration (such as fish friendly turbines, fish guidance structures, state-of the-art fully functional fish passes, measures to stop or minimise operation and discharges during migration or spawning); measures to ensure minimum ecological flow (including mitigation of rapid, short-term variations in flow or hydro-peaking operations) and sediment flow; measures to protect or enhance habitats.

The assessment is based on recent, comprehensive and accurate data, including monitoring data on biological quality elements that are specifically sensitive to hydromorphological alterations, and on the expected status of the water body as a result of the new activities, as compared to its current one. It assesses, in particular, the cumulated impacts of the new project with other existing or planned infrastructure in the river basin.

All technically feasible and ecologically relevant mitigation measures are implemented to reduce adverse impacts on water as well as on protected habitats and species directly dependent on water. Mitigation measures include, where relevant and depending on the ecosystems naturally present in the affected water bodies: measures to ensure conditions as close as possible to undisturbed continuity, including measures to ensure longitudinal and lateral continuity, minimum ecological flow and sediment flow; measures to protect or enhance morphological conditions and habitats for aquatic species; measures to reduce adverse impacts of eutrophication. The effectiveness of those measures is monitored in the context of the authorisation or permit setting out the conditions aimed at achieving good status or potential of the affected water body. The project does not permanently compromise the achievement of good status/potential in any of the water bodies in the same river basin district. In addition to the mitigation measures, and where relevant, compensatory measures are implemented to ensure that the project does not result in overall deterioration of status of water bodies in the same river basin district. That result is achieved by restoring (longitudinal or lateral) continuity within the same river basin district to an extent that compensates the disruption of continuity, which the planned navigation infrastructure project may cause.

The management system associated with the activity in place complies with the due diligence obligation and legality requirements laid down in Regulation (EU) No 995/2010.1.7. The forest management plan or equivalent instrument provides for monitoring which ensures the correctness of the information contained in the plan, in particular as regards the data relating to the involved area. 2. Audit Within two years after the beginning of the activity and every 10 years thereafter, the compliance of the activity with the substantial contribution to climate change mitigation criteria and the DNSH criteria are verified by either of the following: the relevant national competent authorities; an independent third-party certifier, at the request of national authorities or the operator of the activity. In order to reduce costs, audits may be performed together with any forest certification, climate certification or other audit. The independent third-party certifier may not have any conflict of interest with the owner or the funder, and may not be involved in the development or operation of the activity. 3. Group assessment The compliance with the DNSH criteria may be checked: at the level of the forest sourcing area(64)‘Sourcing area’ means the geographically defined area from which the forest biomass feedstock is sourced, from which reliable and independent information is available and where conditions are sufficiently homogeneous to evaluate the risk of the sustainability and legality characteristics of the forest biomass. as defined by Directive (EU) 2018/2001; at the level of a group of holdings sufficiently homogeneous to evaluate the risk of the sustainability of the forest activity, provided that all those holdings have a durable relationship between them and participate in the activity and the group of those holdings remains the same for all subsequent audits.', 'The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix B to this Annex. Detailed information referred to in point 1.2.

The assessment is based on recent, comprehensive and accurate data, including monitoring data on biological quality elements that are specifically sensitive to hydromorphological alterations, and on the expected status of the water body as a result of the new activities, as compared to its current one. It assesses in particular the cumulated impacts of this new project with other existing or planned infrastructure in the river basin. 3.2. On the basis of that impact assessment, it has been established that the plant is conceived, by design and location and by mitigation measures, so that it complies with one of the following requirements: the plant does not entail any deterioration nor compromises the achievement of good status or potential of the specific water body it relates to; where the plant risks to deteriorate or compromise the achievement of good status/potential of the specific water body it relates to, such deterioration is not significant, and is justified by a detailed cost-benefit assessment demonstrating both of the following: the reasons of overriding public interest or the fact that benefits expected from the planned hydropower plant outweigh the costs from deteriorating the status of water that are accruing to the environment and to society; the fact that the overriding public interest or the benefits expected from the plant cannot, for reasons of technical feasibility or disproportionate cost, be achieved by alternative means that would lead to a better environmental outcome (such as refurbishing of existing hydropower plants or use of technologies not disrupting river continuity). 3.3. All technically feasible and ecologically relevant mitigation measures are implemented to reduce adverse impacts on water as well as on protected habitats and species directly dependent on water. Mitigation measures include, where relevant and depending on the ecosystems naturally present in the affected water bodies: measures to ensure downstream and upstream fish migration (such as fish friendly turbines, fish guidance structures, state-of the-art fully functional fish passes, measures to stop or minimise operation and discharges during migration or spawning); measures to ensure minimum ecological flow (including mitigation of rapid, short-term variations in flow or hydro-peaking operations) and sediment flow; measures to protect or enhance habitats. The effectiveness of those measures is monitored in the context of the authorisation or permit setting out the conditions aimed at achieving good status or potential of the affected water body. 3.4. The plant does not permanently compromise the achievement of good status/potential in any of the water bodies in the same river basin district. 3.5. In addition to the mitigation measures referred to above, and where relevant, compensatory measures are implemented to ensure that the project does not increase the fragmentation of water bodies in the same river basin district.

In accordance with Article 4 of Directive 2000/60/EC and in particular paragraph 7 of that Article, prior to refurbishment/construction, an impact assessment of the project is carried out to assess all its potential impacts on the status of water bodies within the same river basin and on protected habitats and species directly dependent on water, considering in particular migration corridors, free-flowing rivers or ecosystems close to undisturbed conditions. The assessment is based on recent, comprehensive and accurate data, including monitoring data on biological quality elements that are specifically sensitive to hydromorphological alterations, and on the expected status of the water body as a result of the new activities, as compared to its current one. It assesses, in particular, the cumulated impacts of this new project with other existing or planned infrastructure in the river basin. On the basis of that impact assessment, it has been established that the project is conceived, by design and location and by mitigation measures, so that it complies with one of the following requirements: the project does not entail any deterioration nor compromises the achievement of good status or potential of the specific water body it relates to, where the project risks to deteriorate or compromise the achievement of good status/potential of the specific water body it relates to, such deterioration is not significant, and is justified by a detailed cost-benefit assessment demonstrating both of the following: the overriding reasons in the public interest or the fact that the benefits expected from the planned navigation infrastructure project in terms of benefits to climate change mitigation/adaptation outweigh the costs from deteriorating the status of water that are accruing to the environment and to society the fact that the overriding public interest or the benefits expected from the activity cannot, for reasons of technical feasibility or disproportionate cost, be achieved by alternative means that would lead to a better environmental outcome (such as nature based solution, alternative location, rehabilitation/refurbishment of existing infrastructures, or use of technologies not disrupting river continuity). All technically feasible and ecologically relevant mitigation measures are implemented to reduce adverse impacts on water as well as on protected habitats and species directly dependent on water. Mitigation measures include, where relevant and depending on the ecosystems naturally present in the affected water bodies: measures to ensure conditions as close as possible to undisturbed continuity (including measures to ensure longitudinal and lateral continuity, minimum ecological flow and sediment flow); measures to protect or enhance morphological conditions and habitats for aquatic species; measures to reduce adverse impacts of eutrophication. The effectiveness of those measures is monitored in the context of the authorisation or permit setting out the conditions aimed at achieving good status or potential of the affected water body. The project does not permanently compromise the achievement of good status/potential in any of the water bodies in the same river basin district. In addition to the mitigation measures referred to above, and where relevant, compensatory measures are implemented to ensure that the project does not result in overall deterioration of status of water bodies in the same river basin district. This is achieved by restoring (longitudinal or lateral) continuity within the same river basin district to an extent that compensates the disruption of continuity, which the planned navigation infrastructure project may cause.

With the exception of legal restrictions on contractual conditions and insurance premiums, the insurance activity provides incentives for risk reduction by setting out the (pre)-conditions for the insurance coverage of risk and by acting as a price signal of risk. For the purpose of this point, reduced premiums or deductibles, possibly based on supportive information on existing/possible actions, to policyholders who protect an asset or activity against natural catastrophes damages may be considered an incentive for risk reduction. 1.4. After a climate risk event, the insurer provides information on the conditions under which coverage under the insurance activity could be renewed or maintained and in particular the benefits of building better in that context. 2. Product design: 2.1. Insurance products sold under the insurance activity offer risk-based rewards for preventive actions taken by policyholders. For the purpose of this point, where a policyholder has invested in adaptation measures, lower premiums may be considered as a risk-based reward for preventive actions taken by policyholders. By way of derogation from this point, where legal restrictions on contractual conditions and insurance premiums prevent the insurance or reinsurance company from providing risk-based rewards, insurance products may instead provide to customers measures in relation to an asset, an activity, or people that prevent or protect against natural catastrophes. Such measures may be provided as information or advice to customers on climate risks and preventive measures that customers could take. 2.2. The distribution strategy for such products covers measures to ensure that policyholders are informed on the relevance of preventive measures that they could take, for the terms and conditions of the insurance coverage, including any impact of such measures on the insurance coverage or the premium level. 3.

In order for an activity to be considered as an enabling activity as referred to in Article 11(1), point (b), of Regulation (EU) 2020/852, the economic operator demonstrates, through an assessment of current and future climate risks, including uncertainty and based on robust data, that the activity provides a technology, product, service, information, or practice, or promotes their uses with one of the following primary objectives: increasing the level of resilience to physical climate risks of other people, of nature, of cultural heritage, of assets and of other economic activities; contributing to adaptation efforts of other people, of nature, of cultural heritage, of assets and of other economic activities.', 'N/A', 'The activity does not hamper the achievement of good environmental status of marine waters or does not deteriorate marine waters that are already in good environmental status as defined in Article 2, points (21) of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 and in accordance with Directive 2008/56/EC, that requires in particular that the appropriate measures are taken to prevent or mitigate impacts in relation to the descriptors laid down in Annex I to that Directive, taking into account the Commission Decision (EU) 2017/848 in relation to the relevant criteria and methodological standards for those descriptors. The activity complies with the provisions of Directive 2000/60/EC(770)For activities in third countries, in accordance with applicable national law or international standards which pursue equivalent objectives of good water status and good ecological potential, through equivalent procedural and substantive rules, i.e. a water use and protection management plan developed in consultation with relevant stakeholders which ensures that 1) the impact of the activities on the identified status or ecological potential of potentially affected water body or bodies is assessed and 2) deterioration or prevention of good status/ecological potential is avoided or, where this is not possible, 3) justified by the lack of better environmental alternatives which are not disproportionately costly/technically unfeasible, and all practicable steps are taken to mitigate the adverse impact on the status of the body of water. in particular with all the requirements laid down in Article 4 of that Directive. In accordance with Article 4 of Directive 2000/60/EC and in particular paragraph 7 of that Article, an impact assessment of the project is carried out to assess all its potential impacts on the status of water bodies within the same river basin and on protected habitats and species directly dependent on water, considering in particular migration corridors, free-flowing rivers or ecosystems close to undisturbed conditions. The assessment is based on recent, comprehensive and accurate data, including monitoring data on biological quality elements that are specifically sensitive to hydromorphological alterations, and on the expected status of the water body as a result of the new activities, as compared to its current one. The assessment considers, in particular, the cumulated impacts of the project with other existing or planned infrastructure in the river basin. On the basis of that impact assessment, it has been established that the project is conceived, by design and location and by mitigation measures, so that it complies with one of the following requirements: the project does not entail any deterioration nor compromises the achievement of good status or potential of the specific water body it relates to; where the project risks to deteriorate or compromise the achievement of good status/potential of the specific water body it relates to, such deterioration is not significant, and is justified by a detailed cost-benefit assessment demonstrating both of the following: the overriding reasons in the public interest or the fact that the benefits expected from the planned navigation infrastructure project in terms of benefits to climate change mitigation/adaptation outweigh the costs from deteriorating the status of water that are accruing to the environment and to society; the fact that the overriding public interest or the benefits expected from the activity cannot, for reasons of technical feasibility or disproportionate cost, be achieved by alternative means that would lead to a better environmental outcome (such as nature-based solutions, alternative location, rehabilitation/refurbishment to existing infrastructures, or use of technologies not disrupting river continuity). All technically feasible and ecologically relevant mitigation measures are implemented to reduce adverse impacts on water as well as on protected habitats and species directly dependent on water. Mitigation measures include, where relevant and depending on the ecosystems naturally present in the affected water bodies: measures to ensure conditions as close as possible to undisturbed continuity, including measures to ensure longitudinal and lateral continuity, minimum ecological flow and sediment flow; measures to protect or enhance morphological conditions and habitats for aquatic species; measures to reduce adverse impacts of eutrophication. The effectiveness of those measures is monitored in the context of the authorisation or permit setting out the conditions aimed at achieving good status or potential of the affected water body. The project does not permanently compromise the achievement of good status/potential in any of the water bodies in the same river basin district. In addition to the mitigation measures referred to above, and where relevant, compensatory measures are implemented to ensure that the project does not result in overall deterioration of status of water bodies in the same river basin district. This is achieved by restoring (longitudinal or lateral) continuity within the same river basin district to an extent that compensates the disruption of continuity, which the planned navigation infrastructure project may cause. Compensation starts prior to the execution of the project.', '', 'Operators limit waste generation in processes related to construction and demolition and take into account best available techniques.

Facilities that have been granted a derogation in accordance with the procedure set out in Article 15(4) of Directive 2010/75/EU are not considered as compliant with the Technical Screening Criteria. 1.2. During the pre-acceptance procedures, at least the following information is gathered: expected date of arrival at the waste treatment plant; contact details of the waste producer, the sector which the waste originates from and the nature of process producing the waste, including the variability of the process; the estimated quantity expected to be delivered to the operator per delivery and per year; description of the waste, including composition, hazardous properties of the waste, waste code and the suitable treatment route. 1.3. During the acceptance procedures, the following elements are in place: a reception facility equipped with a laboratory to analyse samples on site and documented analytical standard operating procedures, with the option to sub-contract analyses to accredited external contract laboratories; documented sampling procedure consistent with relevant standards, such as EN 14899:2005(50)EN 14899:2005 Characterization of waste - Sampling of waste materials - Framework for the preparation and application of a Sampling Plan.; documented analysis of the relevant physico-chemical parameters for the treatment; a dedicated quarantine waste storage area, as well as written procedures to manage non-accepted waste. The personnel dealing with the pre-acceptance and acceptance procedures is able, due to their profession or experience, to deal with all necessary questions relevant for the treatment of the wastes in the waste treatment facility. The procedures are intended to pre-accepting and accepting wastes at the waste treatment plant only if a suitable treatment route is available and the disposal or recovery route for the output of the treatment is determined. For ‘blending or mixing activities’ (as set out in Annex I, section 5.1(c) of Directive 2010/75/EU), the operator is not using dilution to lower the concentration of one or more hazardous substances present in the waste, with the aim for the resulting waste mix to be declassified and become ‘non-hazardous waste’ and thus be subsequently treated in facilities non-dedicated to the treatment of hazardous waste. Dilution is not used as a ‘substitute’ to the adequate treatment of the waste. 2. For the physico-chemical treatment of solid or pasty waste, any treatment for the purpose of treating waste prior to final disposal, such as in hazardous waste landfills, is designed to fullfil the following requirements: limit at 6% the Total Organic Carbon (TOC) maximum concentration in each single input waste to the landfill; limit at 1 000 mg/kg dry matter Dissolved Organic Carbon (DOC) content of the output waste after a leaching test with L/S = 10 l/kg based on EU Standard EN 12457-2:2002(51)EN 12457-2:2002 Characterisation of waste - Leaching - Compliance test for leaching of granular waste materials and sludges - Part 2: One stage batch test at a liquid to solid ratio of 10 l/kg for materials with particle size below 4 mm (without or with size reduction).. 3. For the physico-chemical treatment of waste with calorific value, measures are taken in order to avoid dilution and dispersion of hazardous substances, and to avoid any high loads released into the air due to inappropriate final treatment of waste with calorific value. Any treatment installation prior to final thermal treatments (incineration or co-incineration) is to be designed with the purpose of limiting the content of hazardous substances (and meet other related criteria) for each single input waste treated at the physico-chemical treatment installation, so that the acceptance levels at the entrance of the final thermal treatment installations are respected. 4. For the treatment of aqueous liquid waste, the biological treatability of the waste water resulting from the treatment of the water-based liquid waste in a biological waste water treatment plant is judged based on the following criterion: Dissolved Organic Carbon DOC elimination of >70% in 7 days (>80% when adapted inoculum is used) in accordance with EN ISO 9888(52)EN ISO 9888:1999 Water quality — Evaluation of ultimate aerobic biodegradability of organic compounds in aqueous medium — Static test (Zahn-Wellens method), version of [adoption date] available at: https://www.iso.org/standard/28121.html.
